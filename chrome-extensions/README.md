A Dev Center lightning talk showed me how easy it is to write your own chrome extensions, so I'm trying it out.

### [Website shortcuts](chrome-extensions/speed-dial)
### [Prank colleagues](chrome-extensions/prankster)
### [Automate myTime](chrome-extensions/myTime-automator)
### [Autofill Jira task label](chrome-extensions/jira-task-labels-autofill)
